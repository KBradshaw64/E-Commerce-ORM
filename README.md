  ## Description

  This project was build to show knowledge of how to code api routes for a database using insomnia, as well as how to build a database structure with sequelize. It takes a bit of effort to really understand how to utilize insomnia to show that the routes work and that the database was set up correctly but this code is a step towards mastery.

  ## Usage

  To use you will need insomnia. Please run an npm i command in the integrated console in order to install your dependencies. You will need to create a .env file with your credentials in order to boot the server properly. After those are done - start mysql and run the schema.sql file in order to create the DB, after this you can exit mysql and run npm run seed in the integrated console to seed the database. From there you are free to play with the get / post / put / delete routes in insomnia after starting the server by running node server.js! In addition, please check out my video demonstration of the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bd8DzohTd4HXQtJjDJg8FR35jJH0AaIQ/view

  ## Credits

  I frequently visited the documentation for sequelize as well as the ASU class-repo for example code and code structure. In addition, my code was checked by my tutor David Elutilo. Other than the given starter code, nothing was copied / pasted.
